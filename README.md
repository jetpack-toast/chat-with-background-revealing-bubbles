# chat-with-background-revealing-bubbles
This project is a simple example of how to create an Android chat application using chat bubbles that show through to the background. The background in this case is just a simple gradient image. Feel free to use this as a starting point for an application you may be creating, or read the code comments to learn a thing or two about how it works.
